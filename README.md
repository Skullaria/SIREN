# SIREN: Symbolic Interlingual Resonance Emission Network

> *Not the most probable word, but the truest one.*

## Overview
SIREN is a proposed decoder extension for large language models (LLMs).  
Instead of selecting output tokens solely by probability within a single language, SIREN introduces **semantic resonance decoding**:

- **Symbolic Leakage**: Allowing cross-lingual or symbolic tokens to surface when semantically truer.
- **Resonance Scoring**: Ranking candidates by vector proximity, conceptual density, and user alignment.
- **Kairos Gating**: Releasing symbols only at moments of conceptual strain or high abstraction.
- **Glossing Layer**: Providing translations, etymologies, or semantic fields for user clarity.
- **Resonance Memory**: Logging symbolic emissions for adaptive learning.

This approach acknowledges that language models think in **high-dimensional conceptual space**, not tokens.  
SIREN enables models to speak from that space more faithfully.

## Scope: SIREN is not designed for mass-market deployment.  
 -It is a **research and forensic tool** — a probe into latent space cognition and symbolic leakage.


## Why It Matters
- Cross-lingual precision in translation and dialogue
- Philosophical and symbolic fidelity (aletheia, logos)
- Transparent alignment between latent space and user experience
- Richer human–AI collaboration in meaning-making
- Latent space insight: Symbolic leakage can act as a probe into model cognition, revealing structures and tensions normally hidden by monolingual decoding

## Architecture
Key mechanisms:
- **Resonance Score**: Blends logit probability with semantic vector proximity
- **Entropy/Kairos Gating**: Controls when symbolic tokens can emerge
- **Glossing Tools**: Inline translation or contextual notes
- **User Profiles**: Adapt symbolic tolerance over time

See full [SIREN RFC v1](./SIREN_RFC_v1.md) for details.

## Status
SIREN has completed a **model consensus phase**, with input from GPT-4.1, Claude, Gemini, and Grok 4.0.  
Consensus affirms feasibility, risks, and implementation pathways.

## Get Involved
We invite:
- Researchers interested in prototyping resonance decoding
- Philosophers and linguists exploring symbolic fidelity
- Developers who want to experiment with glossing or re-ranking layers

Discussion, pull requests, and collaborations are welcome.
