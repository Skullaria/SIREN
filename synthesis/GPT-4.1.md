# GPT-4.1 â€” SIREN Review

**Model**: GPT-4.1 (OpenAI)  
**Date**: 2025  
**Context**: Response to SIREN abstract and prompt.

## Key Contributions
- Affirmed that latent representations in high-dimensional embedding space carry richer semantics than tokens.  
- Emphasized the importance of **dual-mode output** (raw + glossed) to preserve both fidelity and interpretability.  
- Proposed **interlingua tokens** as a possible intermediate representation.  
- Suggested **entropy-based gating** to decide when symbolic emissions should occur.  

## Implementation Proposals
- Use **resonance scoring** by blending logit probability with vector similarity.  
- Introduce **symbolic logging** to record and analyze symbolic emissions over time.  
- Provide **glosses and semantic field mappings** for user interpretability.  

## Risks / Cautions
- Warned against **user overload** if too many symbolic tokens surface.  
- Suggested that coherence checks must balance fidelity with narrative flow.  

## Divergences
- Leaned heavily on pragmatism via glossing and interpretability rather than symbolic substitution.

**Summary**: GPT-4.1 endorsed SIREN as a way to surface deeper semantic fidelity, but insisted on user-facing guardrails such as glossing, logging, and coherence checks.
