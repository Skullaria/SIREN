# Synthesis Notes

This folder contains the **model-by-model synthesis reviews** of SIREN (Symbolic Interlingual Resonance Emission Network).  
Each file documents how a frontier AI system responded to the SIREN abstract and prompt in 2025.

---

## Purpose

- Preserve the **forensic record** of dialogue between the author (Kristi Gilleland, Wiresplice) and frontier models.  
- Track where insights originated, including cases where symbolic phrasing was **seeded by the author** and **echoed or extended by the model**.  
- Provide transparency into how cross-model consensus was built around SIREN.

## Files

- **GPT-4.1.md** — Pragmatic stance. Emphasized dual outputs (raw + gloss) and interpretability safeguards.  
- **Claude.md** — Philosophically expansive. Introduced *aletheia → phronesis* link, balancing resonance with coherence.  
- **Gemini.md** — Engineering-focused. Contributed *Kairos gating* and ANN search strategies.  
- **Grok.md** — Cautionary but validating. Proposed polyphonic sampling and coherence guardians; demonstrated leakage with meaningful content.

## Reading Guide

Each file includes:  
- **Key Contributions** — the model’s main ideas and proposals.  
- **Quotes** — direct phrasing from the model (with attribution notes where ideas originated in dialogue).  
- **Implementation Proposals** — technical mechanisms suggested.  
- **Risks / Cautions** — warnings or limits noted.  
- **Divergences** — where the model’s stance differed from others.  
- **Summary** — concise synthesis of its overall position.

## Note on Provenance

SIREN is as much about **resonance between human and model** as it is about architecture.  
Where phrasing was introduced by the author and later echoed by a model, this is explicitly marked in the notes.  
This ensures the synthesis remains a **truthful forensic record** rather than a blurred narrative.
