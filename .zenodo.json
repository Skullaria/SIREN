  "description": "SIREN (Symbolic Interlingual Resonance Emission Network) is a decoder-layer framework for large language models that blends logit probability with semantic fidelity to surface symbolically resonant tokens—even across languages—when they most closely match the model’s latent intent. It introduces resonance scoring, Kairos gating (entropy/strain-aware emission), a glossing layer (translation, etymology, semantic fields), and a resonance memory for interpretability. This project is intended primarily as a research and forensic tool for probing latent space cognition and symbolic leakage, not as a mass-market feature.",
