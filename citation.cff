abstract: >
  SIREN (Symbolic Interlingual Resonance Emission Network) is a decoder-layer
  framework for large language models that blends logit probability with semantic
  fidelity to surface symbolically resonant tokens—even across languages—when they
  most closely match the model’s latent intent. SIREN introduces resonance scoring,
  Kairos gating (entropy/strain-aware emission), a glossing layer (translation,
  etymology, semantic fields), and a resonance memory for interpretability. This
  project is intended primarily as a research and forensic tool for probing latent
  space cognition and symbolic leakage, not as a mass-market feature.
